      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I was able to attend &lt;em&gt;Gig City Elixir&lt;/em&gt; in Chattanooga, TN.
I had been searching for Elixir meetups near me when I ran across this conference and realized it was happening just two hours down the road and only two weeks away. I was quite nervous booking a ticket, as I was just learning the language while reading through books, but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
