      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a bug I never saw coming, which manifested in a code path I never imagined or planned for. Certainly, good testing would have shown this earlier, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have test coverage of this module. I wanted to but I still have more to learn, and that&amp;rsquo;s a lesson for a future time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After deciding to do a clone of what is perhaps the most popular word game, I realized that never having played it could be a liability. I&amp;rsquo;d heard descriptions, seen everyone post their score pictures to Twitter, and read up on strategy. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to even open the website. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After working through a book or two I decided I needed to step aside and work on a project of my own. This would let me take what I&amp;rsquo;d learned and put it to work on something different, without training wheels. The question was what to work on. Should I build a Twitterâ„¢ clone with in 15 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
