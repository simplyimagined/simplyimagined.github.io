      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a bug I never saw coming, which manifested in a code path I never imagined or planned for. Certainly, good testing would have shown this earlier, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have test coverage of this module. I wanted to but I still have more to learn, and that&amp;rsquo;s a lesson for a future time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After working through a book or two I decided I needed to step aside and work on a project of my own. This would let me take what I&amp;rsquo;d learned and put it to work on something different, without training wheels. The question was what to work on. Should I build a Twitterâ„¢ clone with in 15 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I was able to attend &lt;em&gt;Gig City Elixir&lt;/em&gt; in Chattanooga, TN.
I had been searching for Elixir meetups near me when I ran across this conference and realized it was happening just two hours down the road and only two weeks away. I was quite nervous booking a ticket, as I was just learning the language while reading through books, but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming Phoenix Liveview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I had read about &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far. This year I was determined to take another look. I had seen a bit on LiveView on YouTube and decided that&amp;rsquo;s where I wanted to start. At &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com&#34;&gt;Prag Prog&lt;/a&gt; I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/liveview/programming-phoenix-liveview/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Phoenix LiveView&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Tate and Sophie DeBenedetto. It&amp;rsquo;s still in beta, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always had good experiences with Prag Prog books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve dicussed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplyimagined.github.io/post/2023-05-01-story-so-far/&#34;&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; and that I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to a lot of different languages and development environments. When I ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/&#34;&gt;Seven Languages in Seven Weeks&lt;/a&gt; I was intrigued by functional programming. I&amp;rsquo;d never seen anything like it.
Somewhere after this I heard about &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; and ended up buying &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/&#34;&gt;Programming Elixir&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
