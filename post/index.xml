      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I ran across a video on YouTube about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kGuN8WIGNc&#34;&gt;Evolution of the Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;. Every now and then I remember it and spend some time amazed at how we got the alphabet we all take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a bug I never saw coming, which manifested in a code path I never imagined or planned for. Certainly, good testing would have shown this earlier, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have test coverage of this module. I wanted to but I still have more to learn, and that&amp;rsquo;s a lesson for a future time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Them: &amp;ldquo;Hey, what time is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Let me check this clock. Hmm, let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip; that plus that plus 4&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Them: &amp;ldquo;Just glance at the clock and tell me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Me: &amp;ldquo;Ok, just a second, the digits changed, let me redo this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Them: &amp;ldquo;Seriously, how hard can this&amp;hellip; Oh.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After deciding to do a clone of what is perhaps the most popular word game, I realized that never having played it could be a liability. I&amp;rsquo;d heard descriptions, seen everyone post their score pictures to Twitter, and read up on strategy. I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to even open the website. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gig City Elixir</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I was able to attend &lt;em&gt;Gig City Elixir&lt;/em&gt; in Chattanooga, TN.
I had been searching for Elixir meetups near me when I ran across this conference and realized it was happening just two hours down the road and only two weeks away. I was quite nervous booking a ticket, as I was just learning the language while reading through books, but I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I went.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming Phoenix Liveview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I had read about &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; but didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far. This year I was determined to take another look. I had seen a bit on LiveView on YouTube and decided that&amp;rsquo;s where I wanted to start. At &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com&#34;&gt;Prag Prog&lt;/a&gt; I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/liveview/programming-phoenix-liveview/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Phoenix LiveView&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Tate and Sophie DeBenedetto. It&amp;rsquo;s still in beta, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always had good experiences with Prag Prog books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve dicussed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplyimagined.github.io/post/2023-05-01-story-so-far/&#34;&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; and that I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to a lot of different languages and development environments. When I ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/&#34;&gt;Seven Languages in Seven Weeks&lt;/a&gt; I was intrigued by functional programming. I&amp;rsquo;d never seen anything like it.
Somewhere after this I heard about &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; and ended up buying &lt;a href=&#34;https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/&#34;&gt;Programming Elixir&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Story So Far</title>
      <link>https://simplyimagined.github.io/post/2023-05-01-story-so-far/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been fortunate to experience changes from the very first home computers to our handheld pocket marvels today. I began with a 300 baud modem, thought 1200 baud single duplex was amazing, and now multi-gigabit ethernet. I began on an Apple ][ and have used PCs, mainframes, Sparc stations, embedded systems, and now phones and the web. I have written games, a stadium card-stunt generator, embedded scientific instruments, medical devices, factory assembly line software, multi-platform hardware configuration UI, iPhone apps, and now web apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
