      <description>&lt;p&gt;After working through a book or two I decided I needed to step aside and work on a project of my own. This would let me take what I&amp;rsquo;d learned and put it to work on something different, without training wheels. The question was what to work on. Should I build a Twitterâ„¢ clone with in 15 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Dan Anderson, a software developer living near Nashville with my wife and son. I enjoy solving puzzles, woodworking, and anything near the water. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m learning &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; and its libraries with a goal of joining an amazing team to build software that matters. The deeper I get the more I enjoy this ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
